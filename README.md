# 👋 Hey, I'm Uwayss  

📍 Istanbul  

I'm a self-taught developer who loves turning abstract ideas into real, working software. I specialize in **mobile development** and **cybersecurity**, with a focus on making things both **usable and bulletproof**.  

Right now, I’m the **Lead Developer at [MultiChat](https://github.com/MultiChat-Beta)** — building tools that connect and simplify digital communication.  

I like clean, fast code. Not because it looks nice (well, also that), but because it *feels* right when everything just works.

## ⚙️ Technologies & Skills  

**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, TypeScript  
**Mobile:** React Native, Expo  
**Backend:** Node.js (JavaScript), Python, Linux, Git  
**Cybersecurity:** Network principles, vulnerability assessment, best practices  

I work best when I'm building something small, sharp, and actually useful — no overengineering, no fluff.

## 🚀 What I’m into  

🧠 Learning new tools and tearing them apart to see how they work.  
🔒 Exploring how security fits into real-world, everyday software.  
💬 Mixing code, creativity, and automation to make life smoother.

## 🌐 Languages  

Fluent in **English**, **Arabic**, and **Turkish** — and occasionally, fluent in Stack Overflow 😅
